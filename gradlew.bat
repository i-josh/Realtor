// --------------- launch ---------------

/**
 * Launches new coroutine without blocking current thread and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [Job].
 * The coroutine is cancelled when the resulting job is [cancelled][Job.cancel].
 *
 * Coroutine context is inherited from a [CoroutineScope], additional context elements can be specified with [context] argument.
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Dispatchers.Default] is used.
 * The parent job is inherited from a [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be overridden
 * with corresponding [coroutineContext] element.
 *
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution.
 * Other start options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * An optional [start] parameter can be set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY] to start coroutine _lazily_. In this case,
 * the coroutine [Job] is created in _new_ state. It can be explicitly started with [start][Job.start] function
 * and will be started implicitly on the first invocation of [join][Job.join].
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine cancel parent job in the context by default
 * (unless [CoroutineExceptionHandler] is explicitly specified), which means that when `launch` is used with
 * the context of another coroutine, then any uncaught exception leads to the cancellation of parent coroutine.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * @param context additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine.
 * @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].
 * @param block the coroutine code which will be invoked in the context of the provided scope.
